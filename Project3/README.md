Programming Assignment 3

Uploaded 3 java class files, a css file, a file containing character data loading into the project, 
a Project Specifications sheet, and the instructor comments on my code.

The overview of this project was to create a program that can manipulate data and objects stored in arrays

Note: I don't see to be able up upload dndlogo.jpg, so if you would like a little icon image, a file with that name would
need to be placed in your project folder.
